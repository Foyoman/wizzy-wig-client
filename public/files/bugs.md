# Bugs
	
- Deleting a folder then creating a new file will create the new file in an open tab but it will not be present in the file system, supposedly because the file is attempting to be placed in the deleted folder.
  
  Recreate the bug by deleting a folder, and without deselecting or selecting any other file/folder, create a new file.

- Deleting an edited new file will not filter it from tabs

  Recreate the bug by: create a new file, edit it, switch tabs, select it from the fs, then delete it.
