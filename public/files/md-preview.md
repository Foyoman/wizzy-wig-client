This markdown parser couldn't be put together without the help of `react-markdown` and `react-syntax-highlighter`. Awesome tutorial goes to [Amir Adalan](https://amirardalan.com/blog/syntax-highlight-code-in-markdown).

Props goes out to Microsoft for their monaco editor. Specifically `@monaco-editor/react`
